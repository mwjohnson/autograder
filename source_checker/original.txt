In Thailand, there is a festival in April called Songkran. This is Thailand's New Year's party. Songkran is celebrated all over the country for three days. However, in the northern city of Chiang Mai, it is six days. Long ago, Thai people used a different calendar from other places in the world. Their year started around April 13. Now, their year starts on January 1, but they still celebrate the New Year from April 13 to April 15. During Songkran, Thai people throw water at each other in the streets. It is exciting. Almost everyone gets wet, even the police. People put water on old people's hands. The only people who do not get wet are monks and babies. People throw water for many reasons. The most important one is to have a clean body and mind for the new year. In Thailand, it is very hot at that time of year. So, people do not get angry when they get wet. In Thailand, most people are Buddhist, so they keep statues* of Buddha. On April 14, people dance and sing in the streets. They also carry their statues. They throw water at the Buddha statues to clean them. The water smells nice because it has flowers in it. The streets smell good during Songkran. Sometimes there is a contest to choose the most beautiful woman. Another thing people do at this time is they clean their houses. They also wear new clothes. All these things show that people are ready for the new year.
